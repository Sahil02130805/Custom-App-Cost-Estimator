# Custom App Cost Estimator

This is a simple machine learning project to estimate the cost of building an application based on selected features.

## 🚀 Features
- Input basic app requirements via a user-friendly UI.
- Predict development cost using a pre-trained regression model.
- Built with Streamlit, Pandas, and XGBoost.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- XGBoost
- Streamlit

## 📊 How It Works
The app uses a regression model trained on a dataset of app development projects. It takes user input for key features (e.g., platform, number of screens, backend complexity, etc.) and predicts an approximate cost of development.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/app-cost-estimator.git
   cd app-cost-estimator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📈 Model
The model is a regression-based estimator trained on a small dataset of app features and corresponding costs.

## 🧠 Future Work
- Improve model accuracy with more data.
- Add unit testing and error handling.
- Support for feature selection and feature importance explanation.
